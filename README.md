# Inception
This project aims to broaden our knowledge of system administration by using Docker.
We will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in our new personal virtual
machine.

## Mandatory part:
We have to create a small infrastructure:
- A docker container with MariaDB only, for our datas.
- A docker container with nginx and TLS protocol (Transport Layer Security).
- A docker container with Wordpress and php-fpm.
- A volume for our Wordpress database.
- A volume for our Wordpress web files.
- A network for communications between our containers.
